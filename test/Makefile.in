### Commentary:

## Some targets:
## check: re-run all tests, writing to .log files.
## check-maybe: run all tests which are outdated with their .log file
## or the source files they are testing.
## filename.log: run tests from filename.el(c) if .log file needs updating
## filename: re-run tests from filename.el(c), with no logging
